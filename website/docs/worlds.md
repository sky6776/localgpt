## System Highlights

### Genie 3 (DeepMind)

Foundation world model that generates interactive 3D environments from a single text prompt or image. Designed for rapid game prototyping and synthetic data generation.

### SIMA 2 (DeepMind)

Gemini-powered agent that learns to play 3D games by watching gameplay video. Self-improving through experience, it reasons about game objectives and adapts to new environments.

### Marble (World Labs)

Multimodal world model that creates 3D scenes from text, images, video, or 3D layouts. Exports as Gaussian splats for high-fidelity rendering.

### Artcraft

IDE for AI-assisted creative work. Combines image generation, video creation, 3D compositing, character posing, and scene blocking in a unified interface.

### Intangible

Spatial intelligence platform focused on camera-centric 3D composition. Designed for creative industries needing precise camera control and scene layout.

### LocalGPT Gen

Open-source, local-first 3D world generation powered by Bevy. Features procedural audio synthesis, data-driven behaviors, and full glTF export. Runs entirely on your machine without cloud dependencies.
